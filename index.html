  (You probably need <strong>two</strong> catan cities and knights too but made our own knights and city improvement booklet.
  Since the player pieces are all made of the same color, we colored the other player pieces and also created a make shift knights and used <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00001QHVP/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00001QHVP&linkCode=as2&tag=boardgameexplorer-20&linkId=44aeece3326c8f0d81f57abd02779f41">Playing Cards</a>

  for creating make shift city walls for the additional player(s).

            <h4> Game Rules: </h4>
			<p>
			<ol>
			<li> We had two robbers on the board at all times. When the dice rolls to 7, only one of the robbers can be removed and placed on any hex.
			There are a couple of sub rules to keep in mind: 
			<ul>
			  <li> You cannot place the robber on a hex of a player, whose other hex already contains a robber. 
			  At any point in time, a single player will only have a single/no hex of his/her blocked by a robber. </li>
			  <li> If a player has one of his hex blocked by a robber, then the same player, even though he/she shares the hex
			  with other players, should not have their hex blocked </li>
			  <li> There were times where a single person's hex was always blocked and this could lead to some frustration.
			   The game can be made more interesting by removing two robbers and placing them on two different hexes for a roll of 7</li> 
			</ul>
			</li> 
			<li>
			<em>Most Important Rule: </em>
			We set a hard limit of 3 minutes for each turn.  The timer starts once the roll is complete and all the players
			receive his/her resource cards 
			</li>
			<li>
			</li>
			<li>
			</li>
			</ol>
			</p>
			<p> P.S. - Please do not try this version of the game if you don't have 
			atleast 8 people to play.</p>
